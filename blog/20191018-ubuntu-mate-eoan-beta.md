## Known Issues

Here are the known issues.

### Ubuntu MATE

  * The Software Boutique doesn't list any available software.
    * An update, due very soon, will re-stock the software library and add a few new applications too.

### Ubuntu family issues

This is our known list of bugs that affects all flavours.

  * [Ubiquity slide shows are missing for OEM installs of Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Budgie](https://pad.lv/1713720)
    * To work around this, run `apt install oem-config-slideshow-ubuntu-mate` in the OEM prepare session.

You'll also want to check the Ubuntu MATE bug tracker to see what has already
been reported. These issues will be addressed in due course.
